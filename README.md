# huffman-coding
For our final project in Data Structures at CU, Pravan Subramanian and I wrote a program in C++ that implements Huffman Coding.

Since then, I've decided to expand on this repo by implementing Huffman Coding in additional programming languages.  First up was Python!  This program includes the character keys at the beginning of the compressed file so that any file compressed by the program can also be uncompressed.

## Python program usage

```
Usage: huffman_coding.py [-h] action file

Positional arguments:
  action      Compress or Uncompress
  file        File to perform action on

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
